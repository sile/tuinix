#
# Settle a backlog item whose change has landed on main.
#
# Usage:
#     backlog/scripts/settle.sh <item-file> --pr <N> < outcome-body.txt
#
# The item file is the open one under backlog/ (for example
# backlog/20260915-rfc-bounded-incomplete-sequence.md). The pull request
# number is the change that settled it.
#
# The prose written to the script's standard input becomes the body of the
# ## Outcome section, between the line naming the pull request and the line
# stating that the scope is unchanged. Write it fresh at the moment the item
# is settled: it records what was actually done, which is often not what the
# text above it predicted. Reading it from standard input keeps that text out
# of the command line, where it would end up in shell history.
#
# The prose is required. An outcome with nothing to say about the change it
# settled is almost always a sign that it was written later, from the item's
# own text, rather than at the moment it landed.
#
# The script moves the item into backlog/done/, sets its Status, appends the
# ## Outcome section, commits, pushes, and deletes the merged branch. Run it
# from a clean working tree, either on main or on the branch the pull request
# came from; the script switches to main itself in the latter case.
