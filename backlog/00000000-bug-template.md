# Bug: <title>

- Status: open | fixed | not-a-bug

## Summary

One paragraph. What is broken, and what is the smallest input or sequence that
shows it? An issue is a **bug** (rather than an RFC) only when the current
behavior cannot be defended under its own documented contract: input is
dropped, output is wrong, or a documented invariant is violated. If the current
behavior is defensible and you are arguing for a different API, write an RFC
instead.

A bug report is shorter than an RFC. It needs a reproduction, the observed
behavior, and the expected behavior. It does **not** need a full design
rationale; leave the fix to the pull request that settles it.

## Reproduction

The smallest exact input and the exact calls that show the problem, so that
someone can reproduce it without reading the implementation. Prefer a concrete
value (`ESC[1A`, a specific `push_char` call, a specific buffer size) over a
description.

```text
<exact input>
<exact call(s)>
<observed output>
```

If the behavior depends on how the input is split or fed, say so here; that is
often the difference between "does not decode" and "decodes only sometimes".

## Observed behavior

What actually happens, and where in `src/` the behavior comes from. Quote the
relevant test or branch rather than paraphrasing it. Include the invariant that
is violated (for example, "`next()` returns `None` forever although the buffer
holds a complete sequence").

## Expected behavior

What the documented contract says should happen instead. Cite the rustdoc,
invariant, or type whose promise the observed behavior breaks.

## Impact

Who is affected and how badly. Is this a correctness problem (a caller cannot
get the right result) or an ergonomics one? A correctness problem that is
reproducible from the public API is a bug; an ergonomics problem is usually an
RFC. Note any resource effect (unbounded growth, a stuck loop).

## Notes

Anything that helps the fix without turning this into a design document:
related cases that share the same cause and should be fixed together, why a
simpler-looking fix is wrong, or whether resolving the ambiguity properly needs
an RFC. Leave this section out if there is nothing to add.
